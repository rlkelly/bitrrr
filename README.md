imitate rappers' flows


Right now I'm building a dictionary of rap lyrics as a pickle and cleaning the data.  The plan is to start getting metrics on the rhyme scheme and typical word usages of a variety of rappers, and building this into a rap analysis database.

Eventually, this will grow into an app that can imitate rappers flows based off of rhyme scheme, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

It will also be able to take input of lyrics and inform you what rapper it is most similar to.
