aware\\nListen up, boy, you\\'re better off eavesdroppin\\'\\nWe already got spring 2015 poppin\\'\\nPND droppin\\', Reps-up P droppin\\'\\nMajid Jordan droppin\\', OB droppin\\', not to mention me droppin\\'\\nFeel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game\\nMe and Noel been at it before Twitter names\\nYeah, been on the move like the lease is up\\nAnd I can\\'t even name one person that\\'s keepin\\' up\\nDamn, fuck how it was in the past tense\\nAsk yourself, how do we match up now?\\nCause I\\'m only 27 and I\\'m only gettin\\' better\\nIf I haven\\'t passed you yet, watch me
